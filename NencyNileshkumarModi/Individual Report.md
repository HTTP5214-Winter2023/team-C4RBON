In order to get a better understanding of the logic of the report, I was looking through reports online to get a grasp of it and planning to come up with an algorithm that would be able to implement it smoothly.

The team decided that we will distribute the project equally among the members of the team, and we will work on it together.
During one of my work days, I was working on the javascript part of a node.js project on the front-end part of the project in which Muskan is split into two groups.
After creating the algorithm and steps for the logic, we decided to start coding the part as soon as possible.
