# Jigar Mehta - Standup log
# WEEK 1 - 11th Jan,2023
We went over the plan for the entire semester and talked about the required assignments and projects for the course.
# WEEK 2 - 18th Jan,2023
We received an overview of Git, learned how to use it, and discussed the advantages it offers.
We also discussed how to use Kanban board and Trello and saw a demonstration of how these tools work together with Git in a practical setting.
# WEEK 3 - 25th Jan,2023
We were taught how to use Discord channel, a platform for communication and collaboration. We then discussed and documented the difficulties we were facing in the course.
We formed a team, Team-C4RBON, and held an internal meeting to plan and conduct a demo sprint session to test our skills and tools.
# WEEK 4 - 1st Feb,2023
We had our first standup meeting where we updated each other on our progress, discussed any issues and planned our next steps.
We decided to appoint Muskan Aggarwal as the first scrum master to lead the team. As the scrum master, she created individual folder structures in the team repository to help us organize our work.
We completed the Introduction to Github module, which provided an overview of the popular web-based platform, and also completed the Pull Requests module, which taught us how to contribute to a project in Github by proposing changes.
